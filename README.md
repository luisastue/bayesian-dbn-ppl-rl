# Sample-Efficient Bayesian Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Using DBN and PPL Models

## Overview
This project explores the application of Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning (RL) in high-stakes environments, particularly in healthcare decision-making for sepsis treatment. The research focuses on using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) and Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) to define highly taileored and structured models that approximate the simulation MDP to improve sample efficiency and interpretability compared to model-free RL approaches.

## Features
- **Simulation Environment**: based on [OberstSepsisEnv by Luo et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18610), implemented locally using Openai Gym
- **DBN Models** implemented in Python: 
  - `FullDBN`: no facorization introduced
  - `MediumDBN`: moderate factorization of the transition probability space
  - `SimpleDBN`: highly factored MDP model
- **PPL Models** implemented in `Gen.jl`:
  - `SimplePPL`: highly tailored model based on expert knowledge
  - `SoftmaxPPL`: more general model that defines transition probabilities of vital signs with softmax functions
- **Thompson Sampling** implemented in Python and Julia
- **Baseline Comparisons** implemented in Python:
  - Q-Learning
  - DQN using `stable-baselines3`
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Sample Efficiency
  - Asymptotic Rewards
  - Cumulative Rewards
  - Learning Curve Plots
